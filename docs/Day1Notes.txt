# Nascent Transcription Workshop
Goals of the workshop: "drink from the firehose"

* Understanding the experiment
* Data science: understand your expectation and evaluate your reality
* Strive to do reproducible research
* Comparison (usually between 2 samples)

Overview for "pipeline"
* get bag of reads from sequencer
* Do QC to make sure you're not wasting your time
* map the reads
* say something about what is going on

Keep a digital notebook

So far ... install x2GO to run IGV on the amazon instance
Note: I modified my DNS to forward nascent.linkage.io to my amazon instance

# Transcription
The process of converting DNA to mRNA
*most* cells in your body share the same genome

Despite years of expression studies, we have not been assaying transcription. 
They have been doing RNASeq. Most of the RNA in the cell are ribosomal RNA. 
RNASeq protocols usually have a step where they pull out the ribosomal RNA.

Nascent transcription is the step where RNA polymerase attaches to DNA to make 
pre-mRNA. Then stuff gets spliced and a steady mRNA is made. 

GRO-Seq is a protocol for looking for nascent transcription. RNASeq gives you and idea
of ALL the mRNAs in the cell (they could be days old). GRO-Seq gives you what is currently
being transcribed. 

Splicing is co-transcriptional. It happens while mRNAs are being produced. 
GROSeq gives you reads for exons (not yet spliced) as well as for eRNAs 
(unannotated regions). 

**Nascent is assaying polymerase**

Nascent vs RNASeq
### Nascent:
* Pausing / elongation / termination
* temporal response to change
* regulatory elements
### RNASeq:
* expression profiles of tissues
* long term response to change
* isoforms / splicing events
